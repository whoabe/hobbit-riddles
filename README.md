# hobbit-riddles

• Recognized for "Most Unique Application of Spark AR"
• Competed against 40 participants to develop applications with Facebook’s Spark AR augmented reality software using the software for the first time in the course of 4 hours
• Collaborated with my team to build an application that uses facial recognition to queue an interactive story telling sequence; the user of the app verbally answered Gollum’s riddles for Bilbo in The Hobbit, prompting the next riddle in the queue
